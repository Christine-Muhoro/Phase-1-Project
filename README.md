## **PHASE 1 PROJECT**
## **Business Understanding**
### **Overview**
Skyway Airlines is a new airline that wants to enter the aviation industry. It wants to purchase aircrafts to operate for commercial and private enterprises. As a startup, one of the most important things is buying aircrafts that are safe and reliable for their operations. This project uses data from past aviation accidents between 1919 and 2023 to get potential risks of different aircrafts and determine the lowest risk aircraft. It also aims to show how important a specific airline's practices are having the best aircrafts or not. The goal is to provide Skyway Airlines with information to build a strong foundation of safety and efficiency for its operations.

### **Problem Statement**
An airline company comes with high risks such as ensuring passenger safety and maintaining operational reliability. There are many issues that cause aviation accidents including the type of aircraft. Therefore, choosing the wrong type of aircraft would result in safety challenges and damage the brand reputation. Being unaware of the issues that cause accidents would also make it hard to ensure less accidents or little to no damage during accidents. All this may bring down the company as it is new in stead of growing it.

### **Objectives**
1. Determine the aircraft with the lowest risk to purchase for the business.
2. Find the potential risks of aircrafts and explain them to the stakeholders.
3. Determine how important airline practices are in ensuring safety regardless of the aircraft type.

### **Solution**
The project aims to guide Skyway Airlines to making informed decisions on purchasing aircrafts and on ensuring operational reliabilty. That is, it provides aircraft and operator safety insights. This is by analyzing past aviation accident data to identify potential risks and the safest aircraft type. The analysis also aims to show that a specific airline can be the cause of an accident even though the type of aircraft is the best.
